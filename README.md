##### Challenges :

there weren't any challenges with this assignment the only thing was that I kept forgetting to turn my values into integers which resulted in me getting the strings rather than the actual sum of the numbers input in the calculator. I first solved this by doing .to_ i to turn the input into integers. then I noticed that some of the values were being rounded up which prompted me to change this to .to_f so it would give me floats. 

I attempted the BMI which went well. I'm still trying the trip calulator so there may be updates to the readme and the code before deadline.

##### Take-Aways :

Over all I think that the assignment went really well. I noticed that it took less tries compared to other assignments, I knew exactly what to do which was nice.

I'm finding ruby pretty straight forward so far and very similar to javascript which is great because i can use comparisons to understand ruby better. And as always it's a matter of practice, time will give me the experience and confidence I need... Rome wasn't built in a day!

I give it an 8/10.
